% ----------------------------------------MINIMAL STATE VECTOR---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%{

What is the minimal state vector for the Kalman filter (so that the resulting system is Markovian)?

For a car moving in a linear environment, we understand that the system is
moving in a 1 direction, x in this case. So x is the first entry in our
state vector. We don not have y or z because it is in 1D...

The other entry in our state vector is the velocity, and we will call it
v in this code.
 
As for acceleration, it is given that acceleration changes at every time
stamp, so we will assume it is constant throughout t. So a_t will be a
a constant random number at each time step, and does not depend on t-1. Therefore,
it is NOT included in the state vector...

 -- Minimal state vector is composed of x and v, we will call it big X

        State Vector = X = [x; v]

But what are their corresponding values? The answer lies in the dynamic
model equation of any linear 1D system, that is:
    
        x_t = x_prev + v_prev * delta_t + 0.5 * a_t * delta_t ^2
        v_t = v_prev + a_t * delta_t^2

      - Note that x_t means x at time t, and x_prev means x at time t-1 (x at the
        previous time stamp)

% ------------------------------------------STATE TRANSITION PROBABILITY---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%{


The Kalman filter relies on two prediction steps to calculate the prior
belief, let's start with the first one which is calculating the State
prediction step:

X = A * X_t-1 + B * U_t + Uncertainty In State Transition.
 

Two points that should be clarified:
  - The Uncertainty in State Transition Matrix is Mainly caused by the
    uncertainty in acceleration.
  - Their is no control input U ( I will not model acceleration as a
  control rather I considered it as a factor affecting the state Vector X).

So U_t = 0;
B is therefore not important, it can be B = [1 1] or just 0.


So equation simplifies to 


X = A * X_t-1 + Uncertainty In State Transition.

X is made up of two rows and should resemble these values:

        x_t = x_prev + v_prev * delta_t + 0.5 * a_t * delta_t ^2
        v_t = v_prev + a_t * delta_t^2

  Comparing these two values of X, we reach this form:
      
    X =   x_t  =    1  delta_t   *   x_prev   +  0.5 * delta_t*2  * a
          v_t       0     1          v_prev       1 * delta_t   

So, A = [1 delta_t; 0 1];
    B = 0

Given that delta_t = 1 Then:

standard deviations of uncertainties coming from a are sigma_x = 0.5 and sigma_v = 1;
 
R_t is the covariance matrix that includes the variances of the noises
affecting each state in the state vector. So:

R_t = [sigma_x ^2  sigma_x * sigma_v;sigma_v*sigma_x sigma_v.^2];

sigma_x = 0.5;
sigma_v = 1;
R_t = [sigma_x ^2  sigma_x*sigma_v; sigma_v*sigma_x sigma_v.^2]

% --------------------------------MEASUREMENT CORRECTION-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%{

We will now add measurements to our Kalman filter. Suppose at time  t , 
we can receive a noisy observation of  x . In expectation, our sensor measures the true location.
However this measurement is corrupted by Gaussian noise with covariance  Ïƒ2=10 .


the measurement is denoted as z, and is calculated using the following
equation:

z_t = C * x_t + Uncertainty in measurement (i.e. noise). Where z is basically the noisy measurement 
we retrieved from our sensor.
